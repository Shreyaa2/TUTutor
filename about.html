	<h1>The Idea Behind TUTutor</h1>
	<p class="part1text">After years of college, it has been observed that there is a LACKING of available tutors on campus. The department tutors<br>
		were becoming overwhelmed at the traffic of students needing help, and not being able to help everyone. Students have<br>
		become forced to search for outside help, but that can be time consuming, costly, and at times, unsafe.</p>
